# MySQL Installation
Open Terminal and run the following command to install the latest version of MySQL.
$ brew install mysql

Start the MySQL service: Once the installation is complete, start the MySQL server as a background service using brew services.
$ brew services start mysql

You can check the service status:
$brew services list

Secure your installation:
The default installation has no root password.
It is highly recommended to run the security script to set a password and remove insecure default settings.
$mysql_secure_installation

Follow the on-screen prompts to set a root password, remove anonymous users, disable remote root login, and remove the test database.
Connect to MySQL: After setting a password, you can connect to the MySQL monitor using the following command, which will prompt you for the password you just set.
$mysql -u root -p

Once connected, you will see the mysql> prompt and can begin using the database server.
Managing the MySQL Service
You can manage the MySQL service using these common brew services commands:

Stop the service:
$brew services stop mysql

Restart the service:
$brew services restart mysql

Stop the service from running automatically on startup:
$brew services unload mysql
